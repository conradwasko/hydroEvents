\title{Event identification (using local maxima as a basis)}
\usage{
eventMaxima(
  data,
  delta.y = 200,
  delta.x = 1,
  thresh = -1,
  out.style = "summary"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The data vector (e.g. a streamflow time series)}

\item{delta.y}{Minimum allowable difference from a peak to a trough}

\item{delta.x}{Minimum spacing between peaks}

\item{filter.type}{c("simple", "spline") Optional smoothing of data series}
}
\value{
Returns indices of start and end of events as a two column dataframe and event statistics
}
\description{
Events are identified on the basis of local maxima with an "event" considered to have
occurred if the maxima is above a tolerable threshold of the neighbouring troughs/valleys.
}
\details{
filter.type can be a "simple" weigthed moving average or smoothing "spline".
If \code{delta.y} is negative it is applied a fractional decrease from the peak
}
\examples{
# Example extracting events from quickflow
bf = baseFlow(dataBassRiver, alpha = 0.925)
qf = dataBassRiver - bf
events = eventMaxima(qf, delta.y = 200, delta.x = 1, thresh = 0) # 5 events identified
# delta.y = 200; delta.x = 1 # 5 events identified
# delta.y = 500; delta.x = 1 # 3 events identified
# delta.y = 10;  delta.x = 7 # 2 events identified
plot(1:length(qf), qf, type = "l", lwd = 1, col = "black", main = "Events with maxima identified",
